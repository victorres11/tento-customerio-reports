I'm trying to create some api calls to customer.io to create a weekly reporting structure.

I'd like your help taking a bunch of api calls and figuring out the most simple way to put out the output I want.


Output:

Week of {data} customer.io reporting
Campaign 1 Name
Email 1 Name - 25 sent
Email 2 Name - 15 sent
SMS 1 Name - 15 sent

Campaign 2 Name
Email 1 Name - 10 sent
SMS 1 Name - 4 sent


There are a lot of campaigns that exist but have no email or send data, i want those grouped separately in the report like this:

Campaigns with no data:
Campaign 1 name
campaign 2 name


Here's a curl command that works with a valid API key you should use:
curl -X GET "https://api.customer.io/v1/campaigns/7/actions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

  Here's some API calls I'm familiar with:
  https://api.customer.io/v1/campaigns
  https://api.customer.io/v1/campaigns/{{ $json.id }}/actions
  https://api.customer.io/v1/campaigns/{{ $json.campaign_id }}/actions/{{ $json.id }}/metrics?period=weeks&steps=1&type=email,sms



  I'd like you to explore this api and figure out the sequencing I need to get the report that I want in I mentioned in Output for a clean report, that cleans up all the superfluous data I don't care about. The goal is basically to track campaigns/individual emails to make sure things work as expected per week.
